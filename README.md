Hi!  Please see [my personal web site](https://mattmccutchen.net/) for more
information about me.

To do my part to help maintain healthy competition among software forges, I
usually host my important projects in places other than GitHub when I have a
free choice.  Consequently, my GitHub profile presents a very incomplete picture
of my work.  Please see [the full list of
projects](https://mattmccutchen.net/#projects) on my personal web site.

## Job-related accounts

For security reasons, I use separate GitHub accounts for work related to some of my jobs:

- [@mattmccutchen-amazon](https://github.com/mattmccutchen-amazon): Amazon
  (active)

- [@mattmccutchen-cci](https://github.com/mattmccutchen-cci): Correct
  Computation (former)

- [@mattmccutchen-google](https://github.com/mattmccutchen-google): Google
  (former)

- [@mattmccutchen-microsoft](https://github.com/mattmccutchen-microsoft):
  Microsoft (former)

Please use the active accounts above where applicable (I may no longer be
monitoring the former accounts) and @mattmccutchen for everything else.  For
company confidential information, be sure to follow the company's policies about
putting it on GitHub at all, and if you do, use the correct account.  Otherwise,
don't worry too much about borderline cases; I can redirect things as needed.
Thanks!
